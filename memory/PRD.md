# Castify — Netflix-Style IPTV App

## Original Problem Statement
> "i want to build netflix clone for my iptv which should only contain Indian channels which work — not the geo-blocked ones. Use these URLs for movies, sport and music, hindi, german. Build a toggle for showing German channels or not."
> App name: **Castify**.
> Follow-ups: (1) Indian filter for Movies/Music, (2) Favorites, (3) Remote next/prev channel while playing.

## Architecture
- **Backend** — FastAPI (`/app/backend/server.py`) on port 8001.
  - Fetches 5 iptv-org playlists: `hin.m3u`, `movies.m3u`, `music.m3u`, `sports.m3u`, `deu.m3u`.
  - **Indian-only filter**: Movies/Music/Sports channels are kept only if their URL also appears in `hin.m3u`; Hindi & German pass through as-is.
  - Streams probed asynchronously (concurrency 80, 4s timeout, streaming GET). Only working URLs persist to MongoDB (`castify.channels`).
  - Stable channel IDs (`md5(category|url)[:16]`) so favorites survive restarts.
  - Endpoints: `/api/health`, `/api/status`, `/api/channels?include_german=...`, `/api/hero`, `/api/refresh`.
- **Frontend** — React + Tailwind (`/app/frontend`), Netflix-style dark theme (#141414, #E50914).
  - Header (fixed): CASTIFY logo, category nav, search, German toggle (default ON).
  - Hero, category rails, ChannelCard with ★ favorite button, VideoPlayerModal (HLS.js).
  - `useFavorites` hook persisted in `localStorage` (`castify_favorites_v1`).
  - Player modal supports: side prev/next buttons (`player-prev-btn`, `player-next-btn`), keyboard ← / → / F / M / Esc, Web Media Session next/prev-track for physical remotes, and hint strip.

## User Personas
- **Casual Indian household viewer** — wants Hindi + Indian movies/sports/music on any browser.
- **NRI in Germany** — wants both Indian channels and German; toggles German OFF when abroad.

## Core Requirements (static)
- Only Indian channels for Movies/Music/Sports (geo-blocked filtered).
- German toggle in header, default ON.
- Netflix-style dark cinematic UI with red accents.
- HLS.js live player with graceful error state.
- Favorites persisted client-side.
- Remote-friendly channel switching (arrow keys + media keys).

## Implemented (Jan 2026)
- ✅ Backend probing pipeline (~655 candidate → ~407 working streams).
- ✅ Indian-only filter on Movies/Music/Sports (Movies 16, Sports 3, Music 7, Hindi 130, German 251).
- ✅ Stable md5-based channel IDs.
- ✅ German toggle default ON.
- ✅ HLS.js player + graceful "Stream unavailable" error UI.
- ✅ Favorites (★ toggle, "★ My Favorites" rail at top, localStorage persistence, works from card + inside player).
- ✅ Remote next/prev channel (side buttons, ←/→, MediaTrackNext/Previous, Media Session API).
- ✅ Search + category jump-nav + hero Watch Now.
- ✅ Tested end-to-end: backend 11/11, frontend 100% — zero bugs.

### Jan 12, 2026 — LG webOS layout aligned to Sony Bravia / Xiaomi (React Native) ✅
User feedback: *"the sony bravia layout is good but the webos version for lg looks very shitty please make to align with sony and xiaomi tv."*
- Fully rewrote `/app/web/index.html`, `/app/web/style.css`, `/app/web/app.js` (mirror of `src/components/MainLayout.tsx` + `ChannelRow.tsx` + `TVChannelTile.tsx`).
- Rebranded from **IPTVFlix → CastifyTV** (red "Castify" + white "TV" logo).
- Nav menu now matches native: `Home · Channels · Favorites · Movies · Music`.
- Replaced Netflix-style full-width hero with **split-screen top panel**:
  - Left 50%: metadata banner (● LIVE + FHD 1080P badges, channel name, category in red, description, `+ My Favorites` + `✕ Hide Channel` buttons).
  - Right 50%: inline live HLS.js video with floating `⛶ Fullscreen` button (bottom-right).
- Category rails below now use **portrait 2:3 poster cards (145×210)** with per-channel gradient background, centered logo, PLAYING badge (red pulse), gold ★ favorite badge, 1.12 scale + 3px white focus border — pixel-identical to `TVChannelTile.tsx`.
- **Favorites-first ordering**: `★ Favorites - {category}` rails render before standard category rails (mirrors `MainLayout` `groupedCategories`).
- **Autoplay 9XM ▸ Zee Music ▸ B4U Music ▸ first available** on startup.
- **localStorage** persistence for favorites (`castifytv.favorites`) and hidden (`castifytv.hidden`); default-favorites seed keywords (`9xm`, `zee music`, `b4u music`) applied only on first launch (`castifytv.defaults_initialized`).
- **D-pad navigation**: 2D grid handler (Up/Down between navbar/actions/rails, Left/Right within a rail, Enter/OK plays). BACK/ESC (webOS key 461, Samsung 10009) exits fullscreen.
- **Fullscreen mode**: floating button toggles `.is-fullscreen` on `#app` → hides navbar/banner/rails, video fills viewport; hint auto-fades after 3 s.
- Verified live: 5 rails, 163 cards render, banner updates on card focus, PLAYING badge tracks active channel, ✓ My Favorites turns red when favorited.



## Prioritized Backlog
- **P2** — Rewrite `refresh_channels` to insert into a temp collection then rename atomically (avoid empty DB window if insert fails mid-flight).
- **P2** — 6-hour scheduled re-probe (APScheduler).
- **P2** — Hero rotator (cycle 5 hero channels every 8 s).
- **P3** — EPG (xmltv) integration if playlist provides `tvg-url`.
- **P3** — Emergent Google Auth so favorites sync across devices.
- **P3** — Share button that copies a deep-link (`?play=<channel-id>`).

## Next Tasks
- 6-hour scheduled re-probe.
- Deep-link share URL.

### Jan 12, 2026 (b) — LG webOS: Channels A-Z view + Remote hint bar ✅
User follow-up: *"Add a Channels all-channels view (currently nav item behaves like Home). Wire an explicit Back on-screen hint for LG magic remote users."*
- **`Channels` nav item** now shows an **A-Z alphabetical grid** of every visible channel — 27 letter buckets (A-Z + `#` for non-alpha), 873 cards laid out in a flex-wrap grid (~11 per row on 1920×1080). Section headers use red 22 px letter titles + channel count.
- **D-pad grid navigation**: added geometric row-based nav — `ArrowUp/Down` finds the closest card by X-coordinate in the previous/next row (works across letter section boundaries); `ArrowLeft/Right` moves through siblings.
- **Persistent Remote hint bar** (`.hint-bar`, `data-testid="hint-bar"`) fixed at bottom with 4 LG Magic Remote hints:
  - `◀ BACK` · contextual label (`Stop stream` while playing, `Exit Fullscreen` in fullscreen, `Home` otherwise).
  - `● RED` (403) · Toggle Favorite.
  - `● GREEN` (404) · Fullscreen.
  - `OK` · Play channel.
- Wired **LG Magic Remote color buttons** (keyCode 403/404) to favorite toggle and fullscreen.
- **BACK/ESC/webOS 461/Samsung 10009** now cascades: fullscreen → exit fullscreen → active playback → stop playback → (else no-op). Hint text and PLAYING badge update accordingly.
- Hint bar auto-hides during fullscreen mode.
